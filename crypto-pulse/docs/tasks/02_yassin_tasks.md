# Yassin Mahmoud — DataOps & Spark Engineer

**Role:** Data Processing Engineer  
**Core Responsibility:** Transform raw data from Kafka into clean, structured data in Azure Data Lake — across both real-time streaming and historical batch paths.

---

## Milestone 1 — Bronze Layer Pipeline

**Goal:** Build the entry point for all project data. Every message arriving from Kafka must be captured reliably in Azure as-is.

---

### Task 1.1 — Streaming Consumer (Bronze) [COMPLETE]

**Files:**
- `processing/spark_jobs/bronze_consumer.py`
- `spark-apps/bronze_consumer.py` (copy mounted into Docker)

**What was done:**
- [x] Reads from Kafka topic `crypto.realtime.prices` via `spark.readStream`
- [x] Configures SparkSession with Azure ADLS Gen2 OAuth2 authentication using a Service Principal (`ClientCredsTokenProvider`)
- [x] Casts binary Kafka value to String and preserves all Kafka metadata columns: `kafka_key`, `raw_value`, `topic`, `partition`, `offset`, `kafka_timestamp`, `ingested_at`
- [x] Writes to ADLS path `bronze/prices` in **Delta Lake** format
- [x] Checkpoint stored at `checkpoints/bronze/prices`
- [x] Trigger: every 30 seconds
- [x] Stream uses `failOnDataLoss=false` to handle Kafka offset gaps after restarts

---

### Task 1.2 — Historical Loader (Batch) [COMPLETE]

**File:** `processing/spark_jobs/historical_loader.py`

**What was done:**
- [x] Reads raw OHLCV JSON files from `data/historical/`
- [x] Parses the raw arrays, adds `symbol` and `ingested_at` columns
- [x] Writes to `bronze/historical` in Delta format using overwrite mode

---

### Task 1.3 — Airflow DAG for Historical Pipeline [COMPLETE]

**File:** `dags/etl_pipeline_dag.py`

**What was done:**
- [x] Created DAG `crypto_pulse_etl_pipeline` running `@daily`
- [x] Four tasks defined:
  - `fetch_historical_data` — runs `historical_fetcher.py`
  - `ingest_historical_to_bronze` — runs `historical_loader.py` via spark-submit
  - `process_historical_to_silver` — runs `silver_historical_processor.py` via spark-submit
  - `process_realtime_prices_to_silver` — runs `silver_prices_processor.py` independently
- [x] Dependency chain: `fetch → ingest → process_historical`. Prices Silver runs independently in parallel.

---

## Milestone 2 — Silver Layer Pipeline

**Goal:** Transform the raw Bronze data into cleaned, typed, deduplicated, and partitioned data ready for analytics.

---

### Task 2.1 — Silver Prices Processor — Real-time Streaming [COMPLETE]

**File:** `processing/spark_jobs/silver_prices_processor.py`

**What was done:**
- [x] Reads the Bronze Delta table as a continuous stream (`spark.readStream.format("delta")`)
- [x] Parses `raw_value` JSON using a defined schema: `symbol`, `price`, `volume_24h`, `timestamp`, `source`
- [x] Converts Unix millisecond timestamp to UTC `TimestampType`
- [x] Applies Data Quality filters:
  - Removes rows with null `symbol`, null `price`, null `event_time`
  - Removes rows where `price <= 0` or `volume_24h <= 0`
  - Drops duplicates on `(symbol, event_time)`
- [x] Adds partition columns: `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`
- [x] Uses `foreachBatch` to apply a **Delta MERGE (Upsert)** per micro-batch:
  - If a row with matching `(symbol, event_time)` already exists → UPDATE
  - If new → INSERT
- [x] Creates the Silver Delta table automatically on the first batch if it does not exist
- [x] Trigger: every 30 seconds
- [x] Checkpoint: `checkpoints/silver/prices`
- [x] Validated end-to-end: data flows from Binance → Kafka → Bronze → Silver on Azure ADLS Gen2

---

### Task 2.2 — Silver Historical Processor — Batch [COMPLETE]

**File:** `processing/spark_jobs/silver_historical_processor.py`

**What was done:**
- [x] Reads from `bronze/historical` (Delta batch read)
- [x] Applies type casting, null filtering, and deduplication
- [x] Writes to `silver/historical` partitioned by symbol and date

---

### Task 2.3 — Delta Lake Upgrade [COMPLETE]

- [x] Both Bronze and Silver layers use Delta Lake format
- [x] SparkSession configured with `DeltaSparkSessionExtension` and `DeltaCatalog`
- [x] Delta JARs pre-installed in the custom Spark Docker image (`delta-spark_2.12:3.2.0`, `delta-storage:3.2.0`)
